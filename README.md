# Jengamon's Launchpad X for Bitwig

## Why not DrivenByMoss?

I love the work that Moss has done, and I would switch between the two scripts.
It's just that I wanted a more tactile version of the script, that more
took advantage for the hardware's features rather than replace them.

Basically, I wanted it to work almost exactly like it does in the manual.

There are some changes, which I probably should document, but nahhh for now.

This script is much cleaner than my Mini Mk3 script. I might port over the Mk3
to this framework, but we'll see.
